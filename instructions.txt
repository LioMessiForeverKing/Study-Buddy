Project 

StudyBuddy aims to transform learning for students. Shifting from standardized school education system, StudyBuddy allows students to learn at their own pace, stay organized, and stay engaged.

We see Artificial Intelligence as a tool that should be used to democratize knowledge rather than privatize it as a result person's background, race, income, etc.

Through the use of personalized AI tutors, syllabi, lesson plans, homework, and quizzes, we bring about a new way of learning that focuses on the preferences of each indivdual student.

A hyper-personalized way of learning will allow all students regardless of how they study to have [equal access to the world's information]. 

Studying no longer has to be a boring chore. By using gamified elements, studying will be something that students look forward to.
