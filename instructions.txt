Project 

StudyBuddy aims to transform learning for students. Shifting from standardized school education system, StudyBuddy allows students to 
learn at their own pace, stay organized, and stay engaged.

We see Artificial Intelligence as a tool that should be used to democratize knowledge rather than privatize it as a result person's 
background, race, income, etc.

Through the use of personalized AI tutors, syllabi, lesson plans, homework, and quizzes, we bring about a new way of learning that 
focuses on the preferences of each indivdual student.

A hyper-personalized way of learning will allow all students regardless of how they study to have [equal access to the world's 
information]. 

Studying no longer has to be a boring chore. By using gamified elements, studying will be something that students look forward to.






Backend Development Process

1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
    Objective: Gather and preprocess educational content to train the AI tutor.​
        Actions:
        Web Scraping: Utilize tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to collect syllabi, textbooks, and course materials from reputable educational websites.
        Data Cleaning: Ensure the scraped data is accurate, relevant, and free from inconsistencies.
        Storage: Organize the data in a structured format using databases such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL.


2.  Develop the AI Tutor Model
    Objective: Create an AI model capable of delivering personalized tutoring experiences.​
        Actions:
        Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithms or frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) suitable for natural language processing and educational content delivery.
        Training: Train the model using the prepared datasets, ensuring it can adapt to various learning styles and paces.
        Evaluation: Continuously assess the model's performance and make necessary adjustments to improve accuracy and responsiveness.

3. Implement Spaced Repetition and Scheduling Algorithms
    Objective: Enhance learning retention through optimized review schedules.​
        Actions:
        Algorithm Development: Design algorithms that determine optimal review intervals based on individual student performance.
        Integration: Incorporate these algorithms into the AI tutor to provide personalized study plans and reminders.

4. Develop Gamification Mechanics
    Objective: Increase student engagement through game-like features.​
        Actions:
        Feature Design: Create elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards to motivate students.
        Tracking System: Implement a system to monitor progress and award achievements based on predefined milestones.

5. Set Up Backend Infrastructure
    Objective: Establish a robust and scalable backend environment.​
        Actions:
        Server Setup: Configure servers using platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to host the application.
        Database Management: Ensure efficient data storage and retrieval systems are in place.
        API Development: Create RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the backend and frontend components.

6. Testing and Quality Assurance
    Objective: Ensure the backend components function correctly and efficiently.​
        Actions:
        Unit Testing: Test individual components for expected functionality.
        Integration Testing: Verify that different modules work seamlessly together.
        Performance Testing: Assess the system's responsiveness under various conditions.






Frontend Development Process

1. Design User Interface (UI) in Figma
    Objective: Create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.​
        Actions:
        Wireframing: Outline the basic structure and layout of the application.
        Prototyping: Develop interactive prototypes to visualize user interactions.
        User Feedback: Conduct usability testing sessions to gather insights and refine designs.

2. Translate Figma Designs to Frontend Code
    Objective: Implement the designed UI into a functional frontend application.​
        Actions:
        Select Framework: Choose a suitable frontend framework (e.g., React.js, Angular, Vue.js) based on project requirements.
        Component Development: Develop reusable components corresponding to design elements.
        Styling: Apply CSS or CSS-in-JS techniques to match the visual design accurately.

3. Integrate Frontend with Backend
    Objective: Ensure seamless communication between the user interface and backend services.​
        Actions:
        API Integration: Connect frontend components to backend APIs for data exchange.
        State Management: Implement state management solutions (e.g., Redux, Vuex) to handle application state effectively.
        Real-Time Features: Incorporate WebSocket or similar technologies for features requiring real-time updates.

4. Implement Responsive Design
    Objective: Ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.​
        Actions:
        Media Queries: Use CSS media queries to adjust layouts for different screen dimensions.
        Flexible Grids: Employ flexible grid layouts to maintain consistency across devices.
        Touch Interactions: Optimize touch targets and gestures for mobile users.

5. Conduct Frontend Testing
    Objective: Verify the frontend's functionality, performance, and compatibility.​
        Actions:
        Unit Testing: Test individual UI components for expected behavior.
        End-to-End Testing: Simulate user interactions to ensure.






Member Roles:
Nicholas - Backend, PM
Ayen - Backend, Lead PM 
Samantha - Backend, Frontend, PM
Mary - Designer, Frontend, PM
Lizzie - Frontend, Backend, PM







Just random instructions: Mary and Lizzie focus on designing and working on the frontend, 
Samantha and Nicholas focus on scraping data, I will focus on the integration of Gemini, and 
prompt engineering a tutor. But if we need help on each other's sections would love to help out and for the 
team to also help out lol.
