AI-Enhanced Learning Path Generator Requirements:

1. Student Profile Analysis:
   - AI should analyze student data including:
     * Learning style preferences (visual, auditory, reading, kinesthetic)
     * Current subject proficiency levels
     * Historical performance data
     * Learning pace and patterns
     * Interests and engagement levels

2. Personalized Learning Path Generation:
   - AI should generate customized learning paths by:
     * Analyzing optimal subject combinations
     * Determining appropriate difficulty progression
     * Suggesting personalized weekly lesson counts
     * Creating adaptive learning schedules
     * Recommending targeted learning activities

3. Adaptive Learning Features:
   - System should include:
     * Real-time difficulty adjustment
     * Progress tracking and analysis
     * Performance-based path modification
     * Engagement monitoring
     * Learning style adaptation

4. Activity Recommendation Engine:
   - AI should recommend activities based on:
     * Student's learning style
     * Subject requirements
     * Current proficiency level
     * Past engagement patterns
     * Available learning resources

5. Progress Monitoring:
   - System should track:
     * Completion rates
     * Performance metrics
     * Engagement levels
     * Learning pace
     * Skill development

6. Integration Requirements:
   - AI system should:
     * Interface with existing UI components
     * Maintain data consistency
     * Support real-time updates
     * Provide explainable recommendations
     * Enable manual overrides
